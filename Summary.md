# LSTM-Stock-Predictor

* Which model has a lower loss?
If we look at both the models evaluation we can compare them and see that the stock predictor using the closing price had a lower loss. The loss for the closing price predictor was 0.053, and the fng predictor had a loss of 0.148. Based on these values we can conclude that the closing price had a lower loss.

* Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
Both of these models did not track the actual values the best however the predictor using the closing cost was better at predicting the actual values.


* Which window size works best for the model?
For both models a window of 1 worked best, however the closing predictor was better at predicting the 1 day window.
